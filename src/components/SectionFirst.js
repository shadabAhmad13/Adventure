                                You can think of machine learning as programming + data. Instead of writing
                                rules to recognize images, Google Engineers write algorithms that find patterns
                                 in data. Machine Learning involves training a computer model to find patterns in
                         data.</p>
                            <h4 className="strong">Human Judgment</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Helps leverage unstructured data to train the model.</li>
                                <li>Provides a human element to the process (empathy, creativity)  builds relationship.</li>
                                <li>Frees the algorithm developer from edge cases(can think relationship more about the
                                average case instead of the worst case).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These approaches are very â€œdata-hungry", having a lot of data is key to coming up with
                                good training sets for these approaches. Human Judgment plays a key role in high
                                quality and unbiased datasets. The more high-quality data that you train a well-designed
                            model with, the more intelligent your solution will be.</p>
