                                You can think of machine learning as programming + data. Instead of writing
                                rules to recognize images, Google Engineers write algorithms that find patterns
                                 in data. Machine Learning involves training a computer model to find patterns in
                         data.</p>
                            <h4 className="strong">Unbiased Data</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>High quality datasets have been the chief reason for the considerable progress
                                    in the field</li>
                                <li>Biased datasets have often been blamed for narrowing the focus of machine learning,
                                     reducing it to a single benchmark performance number</li>
                                <li>The one of the biggest problems in machine learning are the models that exhibits
                                    bias towards the training data and does not generalize to new data, and/or variance
                                    i.e. learns random things when trained on new data</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These approaches are very â€œdata-hungry", having a lot of data is key to coming up with
                                good training sets for these approaches. Human Judgment plays a key role in high
                                quality and unbiased datasets. The more high-quality data that you train a well-designed
                            model with, the more intelligent your solution will be.</p>
